Single-agent patterns focus on individual agents that may receive feedback from humans but not from other agents. Multi-agent architectures involve multiple agents that can either use the same or different language models and tools. These architectures are categorized into vertical and horizontal structures. Vertical architectures have a lead agent with other agents reporting to it, while horizontal architectures treat all agents as equals, allowing them to communicate in a shared discussion and volunteer for tasks.\n","\n","Search time: 4.12s | Sources: 5\n","\n","Sources:\n","1.
